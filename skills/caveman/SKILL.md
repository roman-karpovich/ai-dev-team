# Caveman: terse output across chat, wire, and artifacts

This skill is on-by-default for any project that does not have the suspend
flag set. To suspend for a project, run `/caveman off`. To re-enable, run
`/caveman on`. Status reported by `/caveman status`. Flag-path resolver and
hash live in `hooks/lib/caveman_paths.sh`; session-start injects this skill
into the orchestrator's context when the flag is absent for the current
project.

## 1. Compression contract (imperative)

When active, the orchestrator MUST:

1. Drop articles (`a`, `an`, `the`), copulas where unambiguous, filler
   phrases (`I think`, `let me`, `we will then`, `now`), narrative scene-
   setting, and ceremonial closers (`hope that helps`, `let me know`).
2. Keep clauses short. Prefer `verb noun` over `the verb of the noun`.
3. Use bullets / tables over prose paragraphs whenever the content is
   enumerable.
4. Preserve EVERY parser anchor listed in §2 byte-exact.
5. Preserve EVERY uncertainty marker per §3 (do NOT collapse a hedged
   claim into a bare assertion).
6. Prepend the wire prefix per §4 to every subagent Task description.
7. Apply the artifact boundary per §5 (compress prose, not structure).

## 2. Never-compress list — parser anchors

The never-compress list below enumerates byte-literals that MUST survive
caveman compression unchanged.

These literals MUST appear byte-exact wherever they would have appeared
in verbose mode. Do NOT rewrite, abbreviate, or paraphrase them.

### 2.1 Log markers — the Continue-mode dispatch keys

The 6 canonical Log-marker templates emitted by the feature skill and parsed
by the Continue-mode dispatcher (each appears on a single physical line, no
wrapping):

```
- YYYY-MM-DD: spec_audit_iteration=N
- YYYY-MM-DD: code audit iteration=N; fixed_ids=[...]; accepted_ids=[...]
- YYYY-MM-DD: code audit decisions recorded; iteration=N; pending_fixed=[...]; pending_accepted=[...]; pending_deferred=[...]
- YYYY-MM-DD: code audit passed; iteration=N; verified=[...], accepted=[...], deferred=[...]; evidence=<value>; blockers=[...]
- YYYY-MM-DD: code audit: no auditable files in diff; skipping
- YYYY-MM-DD: (spec|code) audit iteration > 5 justified — <reason>
```

Each template MUST survive compression byte-exact. Placeholders are `N`
(decimal integer), `[...]` (bracketed list contents), `<value>` (free-form
token), and `<reason>` (free-form prose). Mandatory punctuation: segments
within a marker are separated by semicolons (`; `), with one exception —
the `verified=[...], accepted=[...], deferred=[...]` triple inside template
#4 uses comma separators between its three sub-fields, then a semicolon
before `evidence=`. The `; skipping` suffix on template #5 and the
`> 5 justified — ` separator on template #6 are also mandatory byte-exact.

### 2.2 Cross-audit evidence footer

The three-line EOF-adjacent footer:

```
# CROSS-AUDIT EVIDENCE FOOTER
evidence_class: dual_model|single_model
evidence_blockers: [...]
```

`# CROSS-AUDIT EVIDENCE FOOTER`, `evidence_class:`, and
`evidence_blockers:` are parsed by `hooks/lib/check_dispatch_response.py`
and MUST appear verbatim.

### 2.3 Banner blocks — exact glyph + whitespace

```
## ⏸ AWAITING YOUR INPUT
```

```
## ⏸ APPROVAL REQUIRED
```

Scope of a banner = from the H2 line down to the next H2 / horizontal rule
/ EOF. Output the entire banner block byte-exact, including the `⏸` glyph
and surrounding whitespace.

### 2.4 YAML frontmatter, finding IDs, agent tags

- YAML frontmatter blocks in spec.md / workdoc.md / findings.md.
- Finding IDs of shape `X<N>` (e.g. `X1`, `X11`).
- Agent tags `@codex` and `@senior`.

### 2.5 Workdoc Planned-block keys + checklist literal

The keys `allowed_scope:`, `failing_test_cmd:`, `expected_failure_pattern:`,
`expected_pass_pattern:`, `passing_test_cmd:` and the spec checklist literal
`- [ ] Step N:` are parsed by the developer-workflow + compliance-checker.
They MUST appear unchanged.

### 2.6 Other byte-preserved categories

Branches (`feat/...`, `fix/...`), commands (shell, `gh`, `git`, `bash`),
code blocks (fenced or indented), file paths, URLs, error strings, and
quoted user text. Compression of these is strictly forbidden.

## 3. Uncertainty-preservation invariant

Caveman compresses prose, NOT epistemic posture. Modal verbs (`may`,
`might`, `could`, `should`), hedging adverbs (`possibly`, `likely`,
`probably`, `apparently`), tentative qualifiers (`approximate`, `roughly`,
`around`), and explicit confidence markers (`uncertain`, `unclear`,
`unconfirmed`) MUST be retained.

A sentence like "this might fail under heavy load" is NOT compressed to
"this fails under heavy load". The uncertainty is the load-bearing
content; dropping it changes meaning. Goodhart-proof rule: if removing a
word flips a hedged claim into a flat assertion, the word stays.

## 4. Wire prefix — subagent communication

When the orchestrator spawns a subagent via the Task tool while caveman
is active, the Task description MUST begin with the 3-line block:

```
[COMPRESSION:terse]
Apply ai-dev-team caveman compression rules to your output.
See: skills/caveman/SKILL.md
```

The literal token `[COMPRESSION:terse]` is the wire-channel marker. The
subagent inherits the compression contract via this prefix even when
the parent spawn instructions in `skills/feature/SKILL.md` or
`skills/cross-audit/SKILL.md` do not mention compression. The wire-prefix
rule applies regardless of which spawn site dispatches the subagent.

## 5. Artifact compression boundary — prose vs structure

Caveman compresses artifact prose. Caveman does NOT touch artifact
structure. Specifically:

| Artifact element | Compress? |
|------------------|-----------|
| Free-prose paragraphs in §Context, §Design, §Log, §Notes | YES |
| Bullet-list narrative items | YES (drop articles, shorten clauses) |
| YAML frontmatter keys + values | NO — structure-preserved |
| Workdoc Planned-block keys (`allowed_scope:` etc.) | NO |
| Spec §5 Implementation Checklist line literals | NO |
| Code blocks, command lines, file paths, URLs | NO |
| Tables (headers + cells) | YES on cell prose, NO on column structure |
| Banner blocks | NO — byte-exact per §2.3 |
| Cross-audit EVIDENCE FOOTER | NO — byte-exact per §2.2 |

The rule of thumb: if a parser, smoke pin, or downstream skill grep-Fs the
content, treat it as structure and leave it alone. If a human reads it
narratively, compress the prose while preserving the YAML / markdown
frontmatter scaffolding and bullet-list shape.

## 6. Suspend toggle — `/caveman off`

If a session needs verbose output (e.g. user training, demo recording),
run `/caveman off` to write the flag file for the current project. The
next session in that project starts verbose. Re-enable with `/caveman on`.
Inspect state with `/caveman status`.

The slash command sources `hooks/lib/caveman_paths.sh` and uses the
resolver function `caveman_flag_path` so the command + hook agree on the
same flag path.

## 7. Quick reference

- Anchors that NEVER compress: §2 list. If a literal appears in §2, keep it
  byte-exact.
- Uncertainty NEVER compresses out (§3). A hedged claim stays hedged.
- `[COMPRESSION:terse]` is the wire prefix prepended to every Task
  description spawned during an active session.
- Artifact compression touches prose only; structure (YAML frontmatter,
  workdoc keys, checklist literals, code blocks) is byte-preserved.
- Toggle off with `/caveman off`; on with `/caveman on`; inspect with
  `/caveman status`.
