# Code Quality Rules

Rules every developer agent (`developer-codex`, `developer-middle`, `developer-senior`) must
follow, and which `spec-compliance-checker` enforces. This file is append-only as new rules
land — keep existing rules stable so the compliance checker and developers stay in sync.

Each rule has three parts:

- **Rule** — one-line principle.
- **Why** — the failure mode the rule prevents. Drawn from real sessions.
- **How to apply** — concrete action during implementation.

User-input prompt presentation is governed by docs/user-input-banner-convention.md — violations block spec-review Pass 1.

## R1 — Dead code isn't kept alive by its own tests

**Rule**: when a step removes a feature, also remove any helper/utility whose only remaining
callers are its own tests. Delete the helper *and* those tests together.

**Why**: agents tend to preserve a utility because tests still reference it, then justify the
utility because tests pass. This creates a closed loop where code exists only to satisfy tests
that exist only to validate that code. The utility's production consumer is gone — both are
dead weight, and the passing tests create false confidence.

**How to apply**:

1. When a step removes or strips behaviour, list every symbol (function, class, constant) the
   removed code *called*.
2. For each such symbol, grep for callers outside `tests/`, `__tests__/`, `*_test.*`, etc. Count
   non-test callers.
3. If non-test callers == 0 and the symbol is not part of a documented public API
   (library export, API handler, CLI command), delete the symbol *and* every test that
   references it in the same commit.
4. If the symbol *is* part of a public API, leave it and note this in the step's spec Log
   entry ("kept X: part of public API").
5. Do not ask the user per-symbol — this is implementation cleanup. Report the deletions in
   the spec Log entry for the step.

## R2 — Trust tiers for tests

**Rule**: treat tests in two tiers when interpreting a test run.

- **Core tests** — tests not touched by the current spec's branch (established happy paths,
  pre-existing suites). A core test failing means the new code is wrong.
- **Fresh tests** — tests added or modified on the current feature branch, or any test
  referenced in workdoc `failing_test_cmd` / `passing_test_cmd`. These may encode the same
  misconception as the code they test.

**Why**: agents write a utility + tests, tests pass, agent treats green as proof of
correctness. When the user says "this is wrong", the agent looks at the fresh tests, decides
the logic must be right, and makes cosmetic changes that still miss the intent. The shitloop
locks in the wrong contract.

**How to apply**:

1. A fresh green test is evidence that code and test are mutually consistent — not that
   either matches intent. Intent lives in the spec (§1 Context, §3 Design, §6 Verification)
   and in the user's feedback, not in green CI.
2. When user feedback contradicts what a fresh test asserts, **do not** cite the fresh test
   as evidence against the feedback. Re-read the spec; if the test encodes the wrong
   contract, delete or rewrite the test alongside the code change. Never bend the fix to keep
   a fresh test green.
3. When a test run fails, classify failures by tier before diagnosing:
   - **Core failing** — two sub-cases, decide before changing anything:
     - *Spec modifies the behaviour this test asserts* (e.g. the spec explicitly changes a
       fee formula, a serialisation format, a return type). This is an **intended break** —
       core tests often compare against hardcoded constants and will fail legitimately. Verify
       the break is exactly the one the spec describes (same function, same operand, expected
       delta matches spec), update the constant/assertion, and log the update in the spec
       Log: `- YYYY-MM-DD: core test X updated — <before> → <after>, per spec §3.2`. Do not
       silently update a core test without a matching spec intent.
     - *Spec does not touch that behaviour* → production regression; fix the code, don't
       touch the test.
   - **Only fresh failing** → possibly the tests encoded the wrong contract; re-read intent
     before deciding whether to adjust code or tests.
4. Classify "fresh" by diff against the branch base:
   `git diff --name-only $(git merge-base HEAD main)..HEAD -- <test-globs>` (or `master`).
   Tests whose paths show up in that diff are fresh; everything else is core.
5. A core test that *was* modified on this branch is no longer pure core — once you update
   its assertion, it becomes fresh. Reviewers should scrutinise the update against the spec
   intent, not just the green capture.
